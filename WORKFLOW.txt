0. Setup

   source setup.sh

1. Create filelists

   makeFilelists.py store/histos4mu_25ns/*.root
   makeFilelists.py store/histos4e_25ns/*.root
   makeFilelists.py store/histos2e2mu_25ns/*.root

2. Create ntuples (by final state)

   find store/filelist_*.txt > filelists.txt
   writeAllNtuples.py

For each filelist in filelists.txt, read from listed files and randomly shuffle the
events from the files and write them to another ntuple.

3. Merge ntuples so all final states for a given source are in the same file

   find store/ntuple_4mu_*.root > mergelists.txt
   mergeAllNtuples.py
